# Standard Pytemplate
A starting template for command-line Python applications, so you don't have to rewrite all this functionality for every single script.

The standard template is intended for use in applications with no user interaction (i.e., no user input is required after launch). Shell-like applications may want to use a different template.

A search for 'TODO' will show every section of code to modify in a new application, and the rest can (probably) be safely left alone.

This template has an optional dependency on termcolor for text coloration, and will auto-detect it's availability at runtime.

This template was written originally by TheTwitchy.
