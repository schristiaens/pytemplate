# TheTwitchy Standard Pytemplate
A starting template for command-line Python applications, because I got tired of rewriting all this functionality for every single script.

The standard template is intended for use in applications with no user interaction (i.e., no user input is required after launch). A similar template is in the works for shell-like applications.

A search for 'TODO' will show every section of code to modify in a new application, and the rest can (probably) be safely left alone.

This template has an optional dependency on termcolor for text coloration, and will auto-detect it's availability at runtime.

This template was written (and used mainly) by TheTwitchy. Others are welcome to make use, but pushes may not be accepted, unless they're amazing.
